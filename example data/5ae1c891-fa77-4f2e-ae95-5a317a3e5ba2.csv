Testing Plan:
    1.    Tasks:
    â€¢    Replace coolant https://forms.gle/yfk1SWH1h9mnvLLp9
    â€¢    Measure and diagnose battery https://forms.gle/vVkaa7eybvuEzm6k7
    2.    Steps:
    â€¢    Find someone offline or online (e.g., Discord) and give them the two tasks, one at a time.
    â€¢    For each task, provide the manual for one trial and our AI tool for the other.
    â€¢    Time cap: 15 minutes per task.
    â€¢    Ask participants to self-report the time consumed for each task.
    3.    Data Collection:
    â€¢    Once participants complete the tasks, send me their answers.
    â€¢    Iâ€™ll review and grade the answers, draw conclusions using data science methods, and finalize the writing.

Additionally, we can contribute to the testing ourselves as extra data points. Iâ€™ll be traveling with some friends tomorrow and will ask them to complete the tasks as well. If I have any luck fixing the vm I will reach out to more people for testing. But I think right now it's really important to start it sooner than later

Sorry again for the delay, and thank you for your patience! I am open to any feedback!"

For the presentation, you should submit a video presentation and presentation slides. Please upload your video presentation and slides in Google Drive and include the links in your final report. Detailed guidelines are as follows:

Video Presentation - Your video should contain (i) a presentation walking through your project and (ii) a recorded demo of how your project works. It should be no more than 3 minutes. If you are enrolled in 2 units and working on a survey, the demo is not required in your presentation.

Presentation Slides - Submit the presentation slides that you used for your presentation in PDF format.

You only need to submit a presentation recording - there will be no additional class for in-person or Zoom presentations."

1. **more visualization?** we need visualization in the experiment sections - **what's tested? how we tested? what's the result?** The table by itself and caption currently does not seem to provide enough info.
2. **use labels** for figures and charts
3. **review user need assessment, take essence only** If user need assessment takes a page then we might consider removing the discussion section as we also need a one page abstract, but I believe not all the numbers need to be reported from the survey, especially if we only care about automotive diy in this report
4. **appendix** should contain the survey questions too
5. **appendix **table sorted in (user1 used ai / did not, user 2 used ai /did not use) seems more reasonable (grouping users together)?
6. **do we highlight all the numbers?** introduction section remain unfilled, so is conclusion, also I don't think we need to highlight the numbers? but that's up to you guys
7. **metrics unaligned**```Confidence Score: 1 (Not confident) to 5 (Fully confident). Time Interval: 1 (<5 min), 2 (5-10 min), 3 (10-15 min), 4 (Canâ€™t finish in 15 min but could with more time), 5 (Canâ€™t finish)``` these two labels does not match, in scoring, less means worse, while in the time interval less meant better. either we do not use numeric labels, or we revise this part"
