In Lecture-1 we talk about self-reflection and self-correction, wherein the oracle feedback is given to the intermediate output of the LLM, so that the LLM can refine its output to correct for any mistakes. The author makes an analogy to how humans also make trivial mistakes in their CoT. Furthermore, there is no finetuning of the LLM based on this feedback. For example, look at slide 61. This approach is simply an iterative post training approach where feedback is used to correct for mistakes in the LLM's CoT. The author emphasizes, that external oracle feedback far outperforms feedback given by another LLM, which makes sense since neither LLM were finetuned to provide good rewards. 

But in Lecture 2, the author poses the approach as a new training paradigm where the LLM is trained in such a way so that its instruction following and reward modelling capability improves with training, look at slide 52. In this case, the feedback is integrated in the training loop, and thus can be expected to be better. Small difference however is that here, the reward is on the model's CoT plus final answer as a whole and not something which is intermediate and sent as feedback.

Hope this helps."

In order to vote a) one should be 18 years old b) should be a citizen c) should have voter id .... etc. Thinking how to represent this for a long time at least from this course started."
73f5af78-018a-4c1a-b00f-01f729f4c64b,"2025-05-06,23:33:12",farah_abdou,farah_abdou,"from my understanding, LLMs execute conditional statements through statistical pattern recognition, rather than formal logic.
By training, the model sees millions of examples of conditional statements and their implications in natural language. It learns to link patterns: ""If X, then Y"" happens frequently enough that the model represents these relationships in its parameters.
In your voting example, the model has seen a lot of text about voting requirements. When it reads ""To be able to vote."" it generates possibilities like age requirements, citizenship, and ID requirements based on common patterns in its training data. But in rule-based systems, LLMs do not explicitly record variables or execute IF-THEN rules. Rather, they employ neural attention to weight all parts of your prompt and foresee the text that should follow. This statistical approach is an approximation of logical reasoning, though not formalizing it.
so I have to say that the model doesn't ""remember"" rules in the way that a computer program does but it generates them from patterns it learned. This is why LLMs can do complex conditional reasoning on any subject matter without being programmed for each use, I hope that help! :))"
