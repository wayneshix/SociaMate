Most of explanation explain in detail on how LLM generate a text. There's a clear step by step until the last softmax function that will return probability of the next token. That's pretty intuitive. My question is:

How about reasoning? How's the process of LLM / agent can think what they need to do first? I mean if we add tool / function calling, how do they know which tool is the most appropriate. Then, if we're talking about tool calling, probably LLM/ agent will do NER to extract important entities from the user question. Specifically, how LLM handle this NER task?

Does anyone has an explanation or might be resource and reading to answer those question? I expect answer such the math or may be the complete process that we as human can understand similar to how clear we understand how LLM generate a next (next prediction task)

Thank youu!"

SFT which is Supervised Fine Tuning uses only positive examples to train the LLM. For example, the LLM is shown a prompt to which it generates a response and and the response is simply compared with an ideal or desired (positive) response. There is no concept of preference, or best response in this setting. Note that the LLM has never seen (been trained on) a negative response or bad response, however, the graph shows that their probability of being chosen also increases in the SFT setting.

Whereas in DPO which is Direct Preference Optimization, the LLM has an implicit reward model which is to maximize the probability of the preferred reponse being chosen over the bad response. The LLM has to learn to penalize bad responses in this setting and hence, we see that the probability of a bad reponse being chosen decreases with more training steps.

Thus, the comparison here highlights the need for negative examples being used in the training process."

The first one is that the modified instruction x' is asked in the prompt to be highly relevant but **semantically different** from x. This will inevitably lead to y' being slightly worse off than y.

The second one is that prompt deliberately states that the response to the modified instruction while being an accurate response to the x' needs to a **bad reponse to the original instruction x**.  This will also further denigrate y' from being a good response to x'. 

In my opinion, the model has a lot of heavy lifting to perfom in this paradigm. Not only does it have to generate a relevant but semantically different x', but also provide accurate responses to it while being bad at responding to x. Phew. ü§ï"

1) **<< What is the ""program"" here? Is it a LLM? >>** The program here does not refer to an LLM but rather an actual programming code. Refer to slide 46, which sets the problem as a competitive programming paradigm, wherein given a description and few input output cases, the task is to write a program that compiles and provides a correct solution that executes within a certain time complexity.

2) **<< How do we sample at the ""execute sampled program"" step? Is it by selecting just 10 to 20 LLMs? >>** Sampling here refers to repeatedly using a fine tuned LLM to generate a large set of potential solutions. Refer to slide 45, wherein a large set of solutions are generated as candidate solutions to a particular Codeforces problem."

Is it for scoring how well each cluster performed in terms of responses to the generated input prompts? >> and << From the question above, if we are indeed scoring, where is the 'expected output' coming from? >>** First let us understand what the clusters mean here. Refer to slide 45, where a large set of potential solutions are passed through a filtering and clustering step. In the filtering step, all solutions that fail the given (given in the problem statement/prompt) input-output (I/O) test cases are eliminated. Then, we are left with solutions that pass the given cases but may fail on held-out test cases. In this case, the author suggests to use another LLM (trained to generate new input only cases) to generate new inputs for the given problem. Then, cluster all those solutions that give the same outputs on these newly generated cases. This is under the assumption that **if the newly generated test cases are of high quality and diverse, then programs that give the same output on them (thus being in the same cluster) are considered semantically equivalent.** Now simply sample 1 program from each of the 10 largest clusters (Largeness, in my opinion, is indicative of the fact that the LLM is more confident in these solutions as it has repeatedly [consistently] generated them). There is no performance of a cluster as such, what is being attempted is cherry picking those solutions that are most likely using the consistency approach. The LLM has consistently generated solutions that give the same output to a given set of new inputs and thus is more confident in that solution."

And after we get the sampled LLMs - in this case we have 10 clusters, 1 sampled LLM per cluster, so we have 10 sampled LLMs - we use them to generate majority votes for 'self-consistency'?"

For example, to a given LLM, I will repeatedly supply the problem statement (with maybe slightly different prompts or temperatures) to get multiple solutions. You can begin the prompt differently by saying ""Write a code..."", ""Generate a code..."", ""Provide a coding solution..."" etc. to enhance the variety of your generated solutions. So the clusters are formed by grouping solutions that provide consistent outputs to a set of inputs. Here, we have already voted, because, we have formed the clusters. Ideally the largest cluster (having majority of the solutions with consistent outputs) should be the correct solution, but we don't know if the LLM has erroneously generated wrong outputs majority of the time, so to be safe, we take the 10 largest clusters. Since, we take the assumption that solutions in a cluster are semantically equivalent, we proceed to sample only one solution per cluster. Thus, we provide the end user with 10 plausible solutions to the competitive programming problem."

In pages 89, 97, 98 of the PDF, I was trying to link the concepts together.
- is page 89 presenting 1 approach to LLM-as-a-meta-judge where we generate just 'good responses'?

- then in page 97, we focus on the DPO box found on page 89, expanding it further to include concepts on generation and execution of evaluation plans?

- then in page 98, this presents a second approach to LLM-as-a-meta-judge, where the actor LLM generates a similar instruction/prompt (x'), then the same/another LLM generates a ""good response to x, which is a bad response to x' ""?"

In Slide 89, a Meta Judge is needed as we need preference pairs over judgements to perform DPO and train the Judge model, to provide better judgments over the so called good responses. 
In Slide 97, yes, it does focus on expanding the generation process to include chain of thought or evaluation plans, however note that again there is no explicit Meta Judge here. The Judge may or may not have been trained by a Meta Judge.
In Slide 98, the proposal is to not have a Meta Judge, to train the Judge, instead simply ask the LMM to provide a good response and a bad response, and the judgements by the Judge should be such that, y is preffered over y'. This is how the Judge model also gets trained. 

Hope this helps."

In the context of querying an LLM, roles are constructs used for editing a prompt to the LLM. For example, the role of the system, would edit the portion of the prompt that belongs to the system, similarly for user role or assistant role. In general, the content of the system role are in the form of general guidelines of how the assistant should act. user and assistant are the ones who participate in active interaction.

A persona would be defined as part of the general guidelines given to the system. Since these guidelines are followed by the assistant, the assistant would then have this persona.

Hope this helps."

Question about lectures 1 & 2:
Could you help me please to understand how statements about self-evaluation from the first lecture correspond to the second one (imho more than half of the 2nd lecture is about self evaluation and improvement)? Looks like they contradict...
examples from L1: 
- Self-reflection and self-refinement work with good (**external**) evaluation
- Self-correction without oracle feedback hurts the reasoning performance"

The models were most likely training on general conversation, the training data will look more like

```<system> You are a helpful assistant, answer the question as a Data Scientist </system>

<user> {{Some example user prompt}}  </user>

<assistant> {{Expected LLM output}} </assistant>
```

The service provider also built their service and SDK to follow such pattern. I recall at some point right after ChatGPT started supporting system prompt, while many frameworks quickly followed up and added the support to pass system instruction, many LLM did not do so, hence not able to pass system prompt to those LLMs.

But like you say, all these at the end is text input, so the model can process it. You should be able to bypass the framework and service.
The questions are whether it is worth the hassle and whether the behavior will be reliable enough."

In Lecture-1 we talk about self-reflection and self-correction, wherein the oracle feedback is given to the intermediate output of the LLM, so that the LLM can refine its output to correct for any mistakes. The author makes an analogy to how humans also make trivial mistakes in their CoT. Furthermore, there is no finetuning of the LLM based on this feedback. For example, look at slide 61. This approach is simply an iterative post training approach where feedback is used to correct for mistakes in the LLM's CoT. The author emphasizes, that external oracle feedback far outperforms feedback given by another LLM, which makes sense since neither LLM were finetuned to provide good rewards. 

But in Lecture 2, the author poses the approach as a new training paradigm where the LLM is trained in such a way so that its instruction following and reward modelling capability improves with training, look at slide 52. In this case, the feedback is integrated in the training loop, and thus can be expected to be better. Small difference however is that here, the reward is on the model's CoT plus final answer as a whole and not something which is intermediate and sent as feedback.

Hope this helps."

In order to vote a) one should be 18 years old b) should be a citizen c) should have voter id .... etc. Thinking how to represent this for a long time at least from this course started."

By training, the model sees millions of examples of conditional statements and their implications in natural language. It learns to link patterns: ""If X, then Y"" happens frequently enough that the model represents these relationships in its parameters.
In your voting example, the model has seen a lot of text about voting requirements. When it reads ""To be able to vote."" it generates possibilities like age requirements, citizenship, and ID requirements based on common patterns in its training data. But in rule-based systems, LLMs do not explicitly record variables or execute IF-THEN rules. Rather, they employ neural attention to weight all parts of your prompt and foresee the text that should follow. This statistical approach is an approximation of logical reasoning, though not formalizing it.
so I have to say that the model doesn't ""remember"" rules in the way that a computer program does but it generates them from patterns it learned. This is why LLMs can do complex conditional reasoning on any subject matter without being programmed for each use, I hope that help! :))"
